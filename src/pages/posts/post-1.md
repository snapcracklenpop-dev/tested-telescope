This is the very first website that I built on my own, of my own design!  I spent the week learning Astro, and how to build websites using components.  

I would like to use this blog to document my journey in learning programming illustration/ design. My aim is to aid myself in solidifying the topics I study, by reviewing them via blog post. 
I aim practice what I learn by updating this website!


### Whats next

1.  learn how to use figma 
    -  to turn skully into an icon or svg
    - help with my layout planning
2. Build another page to separate programming from illustration
3. Sort out code for making tags 
4. Solve Dark mode flickering bug
5. Continue learning REACT
6. Fix the styling on this list
7. Formatting text for legibility is tough, figure this out
